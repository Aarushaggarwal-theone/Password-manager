# Password-manager

Basic Password manager and creater

V1 is a simple version of the password manageer built solely for the purpose of understanding the alogrithm

V2 is a working pasword manager which saves entries for the next time the project is run
     I did this using a text file with readlines and write methods 

V3 is a more complex password manager system. It allows you to change password for given URLs along with the basic functions seen in V1 and v2

V4 is a full fledged password manager/generator system UI. Which has all previously added functions and more

GUI versions coming soon
